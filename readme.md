# Better Panel
is a better designed panel for botting (localhost used) and its super usefull when you want a simplictic version of what others may say is a shitty menu lol <br> anyways to put it simply it's a redesign of cathooks ipc menu (well) huge redesign <br> i don't honestly recommend using this if you don't under what the ipc menu does.

### info
`Localhost:8080` is the port where the website runs (type into any browser)
has less information from the base of IPC menu cathook uses.
<br>
other than this it's a pretty simple menu
